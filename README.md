Demonstration of classifier accuracy following serial ablation of lower-order interactions from simple (only low-order interactions; 
two classes: red = 'freezing', blue = 'non-freezing'; left) versus complex (higher-order interactions; right) input data. 
Original data are shown at the top. All classifiers exhibited above-chance accuracy on both simple and complex datasets. 
Removal of first-order interactions (mean = 0) and first- and second-order interactions (mean = 0; covariance = 1) affected classifier accuracy (middle, bottom). 
High-capacity neural network and gSVM classifiers dropped to near-chance accuracy (gray background) after removal of first- and second-order interactions from simple, but not complex, datasets, indicating that these classifiers rely on higher-order interactions only when present in the input data.
For the analysis of interactions, we followed the methodology described in Yan C, Mercaldo V, Jacob AD, et al. Higher-order interactions between hippocampal CA1 neurons are disrupted in amnestic mice. Nat Neurosci. 2024;27(9):1794-1804.
